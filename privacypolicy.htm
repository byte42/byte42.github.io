            agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which
            we are involved.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to

    <li>
        <p>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the

<p><strong>In Short</strong>: <em>We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third
        parties that we may link to or who advertise on our Services, but are not affiliated with, our Services.</em>
</p>

<p>The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain advertisements
    from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications.
    Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss
    or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards
    a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety
    and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this
    privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third

<h2 id="6-how-do-we-handle-your-social-logins">6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>

<p><strong>In Short</strong>: <em>If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we
        may have access to certain information about you.</em></p>

<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like
    your Facebook, Twitter or Google logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information
    about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media
    provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as
    other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>

<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are
    otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible
    for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review
    their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set
    your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

<h2 id="7-how-long-do-we-keep-your-information">7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

<p><strong>In Short</strong>: <em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
        this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>

<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy
    notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
    requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the
    period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
    anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
    stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
    processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<h2 id="8-how-do-we-keep-your-information-safe">8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

<p><strong>In Short</strong>: <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and
        technical security measures.</em></p>

<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
    security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
    information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
    100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties
    will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
    we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
    Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
    dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been
    collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
    records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or

    monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
    has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
    automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
    we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

<h5>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</h5>

<p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>

<h5>Verification process</h5>

<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we
    have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that
    we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you
    submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the
    information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email)
    that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
</p>

<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the
    request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
    verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
    request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
    fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

            behalf in accordance with the CCPA.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving
